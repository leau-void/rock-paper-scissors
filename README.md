This is my first JavaScript project, done for The Odin Project's Foundation Path.

I planned on paper most of my functions (although i ended up using a lot more than i though...) before starting to code anything, and I think that it helped a lot with understanding the structure of my project. I tried using different types of conditionnals and logical operators, and to use them in places that are adequate. I think I ended up with a lot of global functions and I think it might be too much but I am not sure. I though I understood more function results and scope, but I found out I had more trouble with that than anticipated.

I liked doing this project as a first try, since the problem at hand was relatively simple and it encouraged me to remember what things were possible, and then looking up documentation when I couldn't figure the syntax out by myself.

I know that for a project of this size, having absolutely no comments in code is starting to be not enough, and I will have to practice commenting and commiting (on git) more frequently.

Adding the UI was interesting as a first experience, I still have to learn where/how to find open source drawings/illustrations, but I liked practicing making everything fit together.
